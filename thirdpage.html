<h1>Start of the Playoffs</h1>
<p>The Boston Celtics started their historic playoff with the Miami Heat who eliminated them the year before but this time their best player Jimmy Butler was injured. The Celtics took a 1-0 lead after winning game 1 by 20 but in game 2 they lost at home. This evened the series 1-1 and from then on Celtics won three in a row by 20 plus points every game. Both Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown dominated this series. Then, next was the Confrence Semi Finals who was agains the Clevland Cavaliers. Once again they dropped one game at home and won the series pretty commandingly in 5 games. Donovan Mitchell and the Caviliers just did not have the same sort of star power the Celtics had.</p>
