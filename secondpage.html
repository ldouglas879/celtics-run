    <h1>The New Additions and a New Coaching Style </h1>
    <p>Kristaps Porzingis proved he was the perfect fit for this team as he was averaging 20 points and nine rebounds showing he was one of the best stretch fives in league. Not only was the pick and pop with him in the action unstoppable but he could also match up with most defenders as he was atheltic enought to switch most screens on defense. Very similar Jrue Holdiay also proved he was a perfect fit as he was one of the best role players in the league. Him and Derrick White were the two best gaurd defenders in the league. He was consistent every game. Now for Joe Mazulla he improved drastically from the last year as he changed up his whole offense philosphy for the team. He wanted them to play extremely fast and shoot lots of threes this led to the Celtics having the best offensive rating in the NBA.  </p>
    <h1>End of the Regular Season</h1>
    <p>The Celtics finished the season 64-18 while only losing 9 games at home. They looked superb all season but there was one issue going into the postseason it was that Porzingis injured his left leg. He was ruled out for at least the first two series of the playoffs. This meant that Al Hordford had to step up and take on the starting center role as well as play more minutes. This was a trickle effect as it led to Luke Kornet getting more minutes who was the third string center but was more than capable of filling those minutes. The Celtics were gaurenteed to host the first two games of the series at the TD Garden as they had the best record in the league. Everyone in Boston knew it was time for Banner 18.</p>
